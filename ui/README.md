# flutter-web-dockerfile
A demo how to setup flutter web in docker container. The demo code is from flutter official cookbook [Animate the properties of a container](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/animation/animated-container). And the docker build web was learned and reference from [building a flutter web container](https://kevinwilliams.dev/blog/building-a-flutter-web-container).

# Command

```
docker build -t myanimate-web .
```
If you have some problem during cache, you can clean cache by this
```
docker build --no-cache -t myanimate-web .
```

## After Success building image
